## YouTube-In-Background (YiB)

YiB is an Android app, which plays audio of YouTube Videos in the background. Also, YiB provides mechanisms for searching videos, playing your playlists and downloading videos.

This feature is against YouTube terms of service and could not be present on Google Play Store; therefore, I have developed it just for personal purposes. 

YTinBG provides mechanisms for searching videos and playlists on YT, as well as logging into a Google account in order to acquire private playlists, which normally cannot be accessed.
